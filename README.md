I developed a fully functional vending machine simulation using Python in PyCharm. This project involved implementing a variety of features, including:

User Interface: Created a simple text-based user interface for interaction.

Product Management: Added functionalities to display available products, manage inventory, and handle restocking.

Transaction Handling: Implemented transaction logic to accept payments, dispense products, and provide change.

Error Handling: Ensured robust error handling for invalid inputs and insufficient funds.

This project showcases my proficiency in Python programming and my ability to build interactive, user-centric applications. You can find the complete code and documentation in the repository.
